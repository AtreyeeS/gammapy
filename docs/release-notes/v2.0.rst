Summary
~~~~~~~

This release introduces a number of performance improvements, new features and bug fixes.
Improved support is provided for Fermi-LAT analysis, and full analysis for VERITAS telescope is supported.
Bayesian inference with nester sampling is now supported.
There has been significant code cleanup, specially with respect to the documentation and the tutorial structure has
been cleaned up. cython code for computation of fit statistics is now replaced by jit code.
Dependence on `lru_cache` is removed.


API changes
~~~~~~~~~~~

Two API-breaking changes have been introduced in this version:

- `~gammapy.EventList.select_parameter` now takes a ``values`` and ``is_range`` argument instead of ``band`` to allow exact matches
- ``cta_south`` and `cta_north` have been renamed as ``ctao_south`` and ``ctao_north``, resp. in `~gammapy.data.observatory_locations`
Features deprecated since Gammapy v1.3 have been removed.

Infrastructure
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- TODO


Documentation improvements
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Documentation appearance has been updated using less custom css code.
- Four new tutorials have been added:
   - one explaining VERITAS analysis along with addition of VERITAS data in `$GAMMAPY_DATA`
   - one explaining computation of upper limits for non-detected sources
   - one explaining computation of upper limits on parameters
   - one introducing Bayesian inference with nested sampling
- The tutorial exposing FERMI-LAT analysis has been rewritten to expose the support for FERMI analysis
- Code examples have been added in docstrings.
